I admit to having gotten a tutor for this one because what I wanted to do was store 
all the records in a dictionary and use the dictionary values to perform all my
calculations. I could not do this on my own so elegantly, nor could I understand
why the month for the maximum and minimum deltas were off, so my tutor helped me 
clean up my code and find my errors.
